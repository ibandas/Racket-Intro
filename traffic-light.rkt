In Chicago, some traffic lights have, in addition to the
red/orange/green phases, a special pedestrian crossing
indication that changes to walk slightly before the light
turns green and an orange hand that appears slightly before
the main traffic light turns orange.

Design a data definition to capture all of the different
states that the light can take on. (Our solution has five
states; yours should probably too, but if you think a
different number makes more sense, go for it.) When changing
from one state to the next, either the light color should
change or the walk/donâ€™t-walk status should change, never
both. Note that each state should show both the traffic
light and the walk sign.

Write functions to support a big-bang program that draws a
traffic light that cycles appropriately.
